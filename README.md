## Business Problem
Your company now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### Key Business Questions:
1.Which genres and themes consistently lead to high box office performance?
2.How do production budgets influence profitability and ROI?
3.What impact do ratings and audience engagement have on revenue and success?
4.How does the balance between domestic and international revenue vary across genres and film types?
5.What are the most profitable times of the year to release films?

Our ultimate goal is to ensure that the company  is able to make informed, risk-averse and profitable choices when expanding into this industry.
