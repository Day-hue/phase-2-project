## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing movies data from Rotten Tomatoes,IMDB and The Number DB dentify the types of films that are most successful, using insights from genres, budgets, ratings, and revenue data. These findings will guide decisions on what types of films to create, ensuring a profitable and competitive entry into the film industry.

## Business Problem
Your company now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### Key Business Questions:
1.Which genres and themes consistently lead to high box office performance?

2.How do production budgets influence profitability and ROI?

3.What impact do ratings and audience engagement have on revenue and success?

4.How does the balance between domestic and international revenue vary across genres and film types?

5.What are the most profitable times of the year to release films?

Our ultimate goal is to ensure that the company  is able to make informed, risk-averse and profitable choices when expanding into this industry.

# Results
## Top 10 Genres by Total Gross and Average ROI

![Genre vs ROI](https://github.com/Day-hue/phase-2-project/blob/main/Charts/genrevsGrossandROI.PNG)

**1. Budget Recommendation**

Focus on production budgets between 10 million usd  and 40 million usd , aligning with the 25th to 75th percentile, to capture consistent ROI opportunities while occasionally considering high-budget films ($100M+) to capitalize on blockbuster trends, but prioritize efficient mid-budget films for stability

**2. Genre's Recommendation** 

Focus on producing high-revenue films in Adventure, Action, and Drama genres to target global audiences, incorporating occasional high-budget blockbusters for significant market impact, while leveraging Horror and Animation genres for low-risk, high-ROI projects to ensure a balanced and profitable portfolio.

## ROI vs Production Budget

![ ROI vs Production Budget](https://github.com/Day-hue/phase-2-project/blob/main/Charts/roivsbudget.PNG)

**Key Observations:** 

**Negative Correlation Between Budget and ROI**

As the production budget increases (moving right along the X-axis), the ROI generally decreases, clustering near zero.
High-budget movies (above 100 million) show lower ROI, meaning they do not always generate proportionally high profits.

**High ROI for Low-Budget Films**

Some low-budget films (left side of the plot) show extremely high ROI, suggesting that low-budget films can be highly profitable.

**Wide ROI Variability in Low-Budget Films**

The leftmost side of the plot (low-budget films) has a large spread in ROI, meaning some films generate very high returns while others fail.

**Stable ROI for High-Budget Films**

The right side (high-budget films) has a narrower spread in ROI, suggesting that blockbuster movies have more predictable but lower returns.

**Insights & Implications:**

 * Higher budgets do not guarantee high ROI. Studios should carefully analyze the risk of large investments.
 * Low-budget films have higher profit potential but higher risk. Some achieve massive ROI, while others fail entirely.
 * Medium-budget films might offer a balance. Further analysis of budget categories is needed to determine an optimal investment range.
